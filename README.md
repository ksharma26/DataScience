### Twitter Word Cloud (https://www.shinyapps.io/admin/#/application/152156)

Word clouds are graphical representations of word frequency that give greater prominence to words that appear more frequently in a source text. The larger the word in the visual the more common the word was in the data.

In this project I've built a Shiny App in R that creates a word cloud on real time Twitter data. You can use it to find out what people are talking about a certain topic on Twitter. I've deployed it on shineyapp.io.

### BillingEngine-ShinyApp
